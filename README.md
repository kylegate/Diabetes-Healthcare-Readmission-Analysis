# Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis: Reducing 30-Day Diabetic Patient Readmissions

## Project Background

As a data analyst, I undertook this comprehensive analysis to demonstrate my ability to solve critical business problems using real-world healthcare data. Hospital readmissions within 30 days
represent one of healthcare's most pressing challenges, costing the US system over $26 billion annually while serving as a key quality metric tracked by CMS. 
This project analyzes the publicly available Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset to identify patterns and actionable insights that could help healthcare organizations reduce costly readmissions
and improve patient outcomes.

The dataset represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care across 130 US hospitals, providing a rich foundation for understanding factors that drive readmission risk.
Through this analysis, I demonstrate how data-driven insights can directly impact healthcare operations, patient care quality, and organizational financial performance.

**Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:**
**Patient Risk Stratification**: Identifying high-risk patient populations for targeted interventions  
**Clinical Care Patterns**: Analyzing treatment variations that correlate with readmission outcomes  
**Operational Efficiency**: Examining hospital-level factors influencing readmission rates  
**Cost Impact Analysis**: Quantifying financial benefits of readmission reduction strategies  

## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The diabetes hospital readmission dataset structure consists of a single comprehensive table with 101,766 records representing diabetic patient encounters from 1999-2008 across 130 hospitals.
The dataset includes 50 features covering:

**Patient Demographics**: Age, race, gender, and admission characteristics  
**Clinical Variables**: Diagnoses (ICD-9 codes), laboratory tests, HbA1c results, and medical specialties  
**Medication Data**: 24 different diabetes medication categories and dosage changes during hospitalization  
**Utilization History**: Prior inpatient, outpatient, and emergency visits in the year before hospitalization  
**Outcomes**: Length of stay and 30-day readmission classification (No/<30 days/>30 days)
